# CropDisease-RestNet-ReactNative
Contribution of agriculture towards the economy of any developed and developing nation is
significant. Agriculture serves as the most important and peaceful source of livelihood and plays
a major role in generating national income through its productivity.
Diseases in plants are majorly due to viral, fungal and bacterial infections along with insects.
Early detection of plant disease is the need of the day to increase the productivity of the plants

Deep learning is the optimal solution for this problem, which automatically extracts and learns
the features that enable the classifier to discriminate the images into the classes they belong to.


## Dataset Diescription
PlantVillage Dataset is a well known dataset which is available on Kaggle. It contains diseases of
majorly three crops namely Potato, Tomato and Pepper Bell. It has 20,639 images divided across
15 classes. Size of each image is 256 x 256.


## RestNet50 
The ResNet architecture is considered to be among the most popular Convolutional Neural
Network architectures around. Introduced by Microsoft Research in 2015, Residual Networks
(ResNet in short) broke several records when it was first introduced in this paper by He. et. al. It
is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
ResNet50 is a variant of the ResNet model which has 48 Convolution layers along with 1
MaxPool and 1 Average Pool layer. It has 3.8 x 10^9 Floating points operations.The network has
an image input size of 224-by-224.
